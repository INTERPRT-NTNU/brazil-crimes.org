# Geospatial Data Repository for [Brazil Crimes](https://www.brazil-crimes.org/)

This repository contains a range of geospatial and tabular datasets used in the digital evidence platform **Brazil: Atrocity Crimes in the Amazon**. The data combines satellite imagery, administrative, land use, environmental, infrastructure, and crime data from various open sources, with a focus on rural land users and defenders in Brazil.

## Dataset Overview

This collection highlights the links between the intensification of crimes against rural land users and defenders, and environmental destruction, especially during President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration. The dataset covers various aspects of the Brazilian Amazon, including land use, deforestation, infrastructure, crime data, and more.
